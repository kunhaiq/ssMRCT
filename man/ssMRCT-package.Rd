\title{Regional consistency evaluation and sample size calculation for MRCTs}
\description{
The \pkg{ssMRCT} package offers a comprehensive suite of functions for designing and analyzing
Multi-Regional Clinical Trials (MRCTs), featuring specialized tools for:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Consistency Probability Calculation}: Computes the probability that treatment effects
across regions satisfy predefined consistency criteria;
\item \strong{Optimal Regional Fraction Determination}: Identifies the ideal regional enrollment
proportions to minimize regional sample size while maintaining consistency probability.
}
Support extends to both \emph{one MRCT} (one trial encompassing all regions) and \emph{two MRCTs}
(two pivotal, independent MRCTs) frameworks. Developed for regulatory decision
support and trial optimization in global drug development programs.

Key functions included in the package:
\describe{
\item{\link{conProb}, \link{conProb2}}{
Calculate the (conditional) consistency probability for one/two MRCT(s)
with corresponding overall sample size(s).
}
\item{\link{regFrac}, \link{regFrac2}}{
Calculate the optimal regional fraction(s) given the (conditional)
consistency probability for one/two MRCT(s), with corresponding overall sample size(s).
}
